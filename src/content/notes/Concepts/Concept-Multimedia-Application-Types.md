# Types of Multimedia Applications

## 💡 The Core Idea
Multimedia applications are categorized by their interactiveness and tolerance for delay.

## 🧠 Categories

| Type | Examples | Delay Tolerance | Loss Tolerance | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Streaming Stored** | Netflix, YouTube | High (Seconds) | Low | Continuous playout; users can pause/seek; typically uses CDNs. |
| **Conversational** | Skype, Zoom | Very Low (<400ms) | High | Real-time interaction; users tolerate glitches better than lag. |
| **Streaming Live** | Live Sports | Medium (Seconds) | Medium | Broadcast-like; many simultaneous users; no "fast-forward". |
