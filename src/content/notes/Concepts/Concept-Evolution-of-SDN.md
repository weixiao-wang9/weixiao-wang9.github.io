# Evolution of SDN (Three Phases)

## 💡 The Core Idea
SDN did not appear overnight; it evolved through three distinct phases of "programmable network" research.



## 🧠 The Phases

### 1. Active Networks (Mid-1990s)
* **Goal:** Accelerate innovation by allowing code to execute on network nodes.
* **Mechanism:** "Capsules" (data packets carrying code) or Programmable Routers.
* **Legacy:** Introduced the concept of programmable data planes and isolating experimental traffic.

### 2. Control & Data Plane Separation (2001–2007)
* **Goal:** Reliability and better traffic engineering for ISPs.
* **Driver:** Higher link speeds forced forwarding into hardware, separating it from software.
* **Legacy:** Established the concept of **Logically Centralized Control**.

### 3. OpenFlow & Network OS (2007–2010)
* **Goal:** Large-scale campus experimentation.
* **Mechanism:** **OpenFlow API** allowed researchers to manipulate the flow tables of commercial switches.
* **Legacy:** Generalized network devices and created the "Network Operating System" concept.
