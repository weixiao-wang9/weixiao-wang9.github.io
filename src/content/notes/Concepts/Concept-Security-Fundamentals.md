# Properties of Secure Communication

## 💡 The Core Idea
For communication to be considered secure, it must satisfy four main properties: Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Availability.

## 🧠 The Four Pillars
1.  **Confidentiality:** Prevents eavesdropping. Ensures that only the sender and receiver can understand the message, usually achieved via encryption.
2.  **Integrity:** Prevents modification. Ensures the message received is identical to the message sent, protecting against insertion or deletion of data.
3.  **Authentication:** Prevents impersonation. Verifies that the parties are who they claim to be.
4.  **Availability:** Prevents Denial of Service. Ensures the system is functional and accessible when needed.
