Welcome to my website! My name is Weixiao Wang, and I am a dedicated and passionate student of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am on track to graduate in September 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics and Data Science.

Throughout my academic journey, I have excelled in challenging courses such as Advanced Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Complex Analysis, and Stochastic Processes. My proficiency in programming languages such as R, Python, Java, and Mathematica has allowed me to effectively analyze complex data sets and present my findings in concise, easy-to-understand presentations.

I have also gained practical experience as a Research Assistant in the Faculty Research Assistance Program at UCSB. In this role, I developed a Python program that detects sandwich attacks in crypto transactions, conducted data mining and cleaning, and collaborated with fellow research assistants to organize and analyze data.

In addition to my academic achievements, I am also an active member of the Global Gaucho Commission at UCSB, where I served as a Special Project Officer from September 2021 to September 2022. In this role, I directed project events for international students, approved budgets for clubs and organizations, and provided guidance and support to students to ensure their academic success.

I am excited to continue my journey as a scholar and look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to the world. Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to contact me for any inquiries or opportunities.
